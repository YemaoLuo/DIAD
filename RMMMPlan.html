        <td>High Probability, High Impact</td>
        <td>There is a possibility that our x-ray detection system may not detect certain dangerous items, which could pose a risk to the safety of people and property.</td>
        <td>We will need to conduct extensive testing and analysis to identify potential blind spots in the system and ensure that all possible dangerous items are properly detected.</td>
        <td>To mitigate this risk, we will use a combination of human supervision and advanced algorithms that can identify potential dangerous items. We will also set up a monitoring system that will alert us to any potential issues or abnormalities in the detection process.</td>
        <td>If we encounter any issues with the detection system, we will immediately notify our technical team and implement contingency plans to ensure the safety of people and property. Additionally, we will regularly review and update our risk mitigation strategies to stay ahead of potential problems.</td>
        <td>We are currently in the process of testing and refining our detection system to ensure it is robust enough to identify all potential dangerous items.</td>
        <td>This risk was identified by our technical team and assigned to our project manager, who will oversee the implementation of our risk mitigation strategies.</td>

        <td>There is a risk that the software used in the x-ray detection system may affect the performance of the machine, leading to a delay or even a complete shutdown of the system.</td>
        <td>To mitigate this risk, we will conduct extensive testing and analysis of the software to ensure it is compatible with the machine and does not adversely affect its performance.</td>
        <td>We will monitor the performance of the machine and conduct routine checks to ensure the software is functioning properly. Additionally, we will have a backup system in place in case of any unexpected issues or shutdowns.</td>
        <td>In case of any issues with the software, we will immediately notify our technical team and implement our contingency plan, which includes using the backup system and conducting repairs as necessary.</td>
        <td>We are currently conducting extensive testing of the software and developing a backup plan to minimize the likelihood and impact of any potential issues.</td>

        <td>There is a risk that team members responsible for the x-ray detection system may experience illness or inadequate technical ability, leading to delays and potential errors in the detection process.</td>
        <td>To mitigate this risk, we will ensure that all team members receive proper training and have clear guidelines for their responsibilities. We will also establish a backup plan in case team members are unable to perform their duties.</td>
        <td>We will provide ongoing training and support for team members and regularly monitor their performance. We will also establish a system for team members to communicate any potential issues or concerns.</td>
        <td>In case team members are unable to perform their duties, we will immediately activate our backup plan and reassign responsibilities as necessary. We will also provide additional support and training for team members as needed.</td>

        <td>Moderate Probability, High Impact</td>
        <td>There is a risk that inadequate performance may prevent real-time monitoring, causing delays and inconvenience to personnel accessing the security mechanism.</td>
        <td>To address this risk, we will use a lightweight monitoring model that balances performance and accuracy. We will conduct benchmark testing on various monitoring models and select the one that best meets our requirements.</td>
        <td>We will regularly monitor the performance of the monitoring system and conduct testing to identify and address any potential issues before they can impact operations.</td>
        <td>In case of any issues with the monitoring system, we will immediately notify our technical team and implement our contingency plan, which includes using backup systems and conducting maintenance and repairs as necessary.</td>

        <td>There is a risk that the withdrawal of capital or resources by the contracting party may result in insufficient funds and resources to complete the development, leading to delays or even project failure.</td>
        <td>To address this risk, we will include clauses in the contract stipulating the contracting party's investment obligations and exit mechanisms. We will also conduct regular financial assessments to determine if sufficient funds are available to meet project requirements.</td>
        <td>We will closely monitor the financial status of the contracting party and conduct regular assessments to ensure that adequate funds and resources are available to meet project needs. If necessary, we will take necessary action to prevent project delays or failures.</td>
        <td>In the event of a significant withdrawal of funding or resources by the contracting party, we will immediately notify all parties involved and assess the impact on the project. We will also explore alternative sources of funding and resources to ensure project continuity.</td>
